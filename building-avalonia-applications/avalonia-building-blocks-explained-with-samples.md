# Avalonia Building Blocks Explained with Samples

## Introduction to Avalonia Building Blocks

![](../.gitbook/assets/buildingblocks.jpg)

The best way to introduce a development framework is to show its of the shelf capabilities first in the most straightforward manner and then, based on that foundation explain the new concepts that come together with the framework. 

The Avalonia building blocks \(and the corresponding samples\) will provide the engineers with the breadth of knowledge of how to operate with Avalonia, while the explanation of the concepts will cover the knowledge depth.

Here and in the rest of the Avalonia UI guides, we do not require prior knowledge of WPF, but it will be good to go over the previous guide - [Introduction to Avalonia](https://app.gitbook.com/@avalonia-ui/s/avalonia-docs-2) and especially its [Creating and Running a Simple Avalonia Application under Visual Studio sample](https://app.gitbook.com/@avalonia-ui/s/avalonia-docs-2) section.

The of this guide is also covered in Multiplatform UI Coding with [AvaloniaUI in Easy Samples. Part 1 - AvaloniaUI Building Blocks](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5308645/Multiplatform-UI-Coding-with-AvaloniaUI-in-Easy-Sa) article and all the code samples are located under [NP.CodeForAvaloniaInEasySampleArticle](https://github.com/npolyak/NP.CodeForAvaloniaInEasySampleArticle) repository.

The following topics are covered in this article:

* The most useful Built-In Controls
* The primitives \(controls that serve as the primitive building blocks for the composition\)
* Panels
* Brushes
* Transform

## How to Read this Guide

This guide intends to be a hands on Avalonia tutorial highlighting Avalonia basic capabilities. It is full of coding examples that I recommend to build and run on your computer. It will be even better if you try to create examples similar to those of this guide yourself.

## Information about the Samples

All the code samples are located under [NP.CodeForAvaloniaInEasySampleArticle](https://github.com/npolyak/NP.CodeForAvaloniaInEasySampleArticle) repository.

All of the samples in this guide were created using Visual Studio 2019, .NET 5.0 and correspondingly C\# 9.0 though they can be easily downgraded to previous versions of .NET and C\#.

All the samples should be running on every one of the supported desktop platforms: Window, Linux and MacOS.
