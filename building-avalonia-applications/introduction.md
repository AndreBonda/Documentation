# Introduction

This is a set of Avalonia guides for **those who** **do not have any WPF experience**.

Here and in the rest of the Avalonia UI guides, we do not require prior knowledge of WPF, but it will be good to go over the previous guide - [Introduction to Avalonia](https://app.gitbook.com/@avalonia-ui/s/avalonia-docs-2) and especially its [Creating and Running a Simple Avalonia Application under Visual Studio sample](https://app.gitbook.com/@avalonia-ui/s/avalonia-docs-2/#creating-and-running-a-simple-avalonia-application-under-visual-studio) section.
