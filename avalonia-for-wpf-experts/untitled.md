# Introduction

This is a set of shortened Avalonia UI guides for those who have expertise in WPF. We assume that the reader is already familiar with most important WPF controls, and concepts. 

 They emphasize Avalonia differences from WPF.  

In case you need a refresher on controls or concepts please read the guides under "Building Multiplatform UI Application using Avalonia" set of guides, specifically:
